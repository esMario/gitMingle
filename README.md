## **Skills**

The following skills were utilized during the development of this project:


**-HTML/CSS(w/ Bootstrap):** The structure and layout of the website was created using HTML with custom CSS styling and Bootstrap.<br>
**-Jinja:** Enhancing the dynamic content of our web pages, we employed Jinja templating. Jinja allows us to embed dynamic content seamlessly into our HTML, facilitating the generation of personalized and data-driven views based on user interactions.<br>
**-JavaScript:** The website's functionality and interactivity were implemented using JavaScript, a versatile programming language for web development.<br>
**-Python (/w Flask):** The website's backend was crafted using the power of Python & Flask. Flask provides a robust and scalable foundation for handling HTTP requests, managing routes, and seamlessly integrating with the MySQL database.<br>
**-MySQL:** The heart of our website's data management lies in the MySQL database. Through careful design and optimization, we ensure efficient storage and retrieval of information, creating a seamless experience for users interacting with our web application.<br>
**-Paired Programming:** We worked collaboratively as a team, employing paired programming techniques. This approach fostered efficient problem-solving and code sharing, resulting in a higher quality end product.<br>
**-Documentation:** Documentation was maintained throughout the development process. Comprehensive documentation serves as a valuable resource for team members and future developers interacting with the project.<br>
